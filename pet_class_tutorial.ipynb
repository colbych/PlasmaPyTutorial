    "### A note about classes and instances\n",
    "A class is essentaly the set of of code that you run to create an object. It is an abstrace set of of instruction. An instance is a particular instance of the class, i.e. when you run the code and declare a varible with its own unique information, that varible is an instance of a class. A more simple exmaple is the list in python is the list (which is a class in its own right). The list (`[]`) is a class, it can hold inforation, it has its own methods that can operate on the data it contains (`[].append()`, or `[].pop()`). However we can have as many different lists as we want, and each can contain different thing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n",
    "list3 = [1.45, 'python!', [1,2,3]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each of these items is a list, they all behave like a list would, but they are all different, each one of these is an _instance_ of the list class. In our example, Pet is the object, and Frank is the instance of the Pet class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes and sovle this problem (and do a lot more). \n",
    "We can create our own data structure that is spesificily suited for our pets."
